<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The HMPPS Digital Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our HMPPS Digital production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organisation walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
<li><strong>REDUCE</strong> &mdash; Technologies that actively want to be phased out and should not be used for new projects without solid reasoning. Technologies that we think are either out of date (legacy) or are not suited to the needs and capabilities of the team. REDUCE technologies should not be used for new projects, and should be phased out for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at HMPPS Digital to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using in their projects.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by the <em>HMPPS Digital Tech Time Team</em> &mdash; an open group of HMPPS Digital technologists supported by senior Technical Architects committed to devote time to the Tech Radar purpose. The group self organises to maintain the Tech Radar documents, including this public version. Assignment of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and agreed in the meetings. The Tech Radar depends on active participation and input from all engineering teams at HMPPS Digital.
